           <h2>To My Love,</h2>
           <p>Wishing you Happy Monthsary, and with this, we are getting closer to the day when we finally meet each other. 💖</p>

           <p>It started from just a random text, not knowing even if I would get a reply, and now I can’t imagine a day without talking with you. Falling in love with you was like finding a home — a home that the heart always craved. Now my biggest dream is to build a house with you, with our cats and dogs. </p>

           <p>I feel so blessed that you chose me, and knowing that I am all yours makes my heart go crazy. Everything seems so magical since you entered my life — like a goddess herself came to bless me. </p>

           <p>I wish to always be loved by you, marry you, and die old together. Every day I keep falling for you — it’s so cute the way you tease me, and you being shy for everything just melts my heart. You made me meet the child in me again and showed me that expressing emotions doesn’t count as weakness. </p>

           <p>I lack words to express my gratitude for bringing so much positivity into my life. Love, you make me feel so special, and then I go on speaking my heart out with you, sometimes even sharing unnecessary information. </p>

           <p>Every dream of yours is now mine, and I’ll give my best to be a part of the journey to accomplish everything together. I want to be with you every day and do so many things for you — but then God says, “Wait, you both still need to pass the test of long distance,” and I know we will pass this. </p>

           <p>And that day will come soon when I ask your parents for your hand, we will get married with the blessings of our parents  and be tied by the sacred thread forever.</p>

           <p>I miss you so much, and I want to meet you soon with many surprise gifts, propose to you in a romantic Bollywood style, and give you the forehead kiss, eat dry mangoes and golden ferrero with you, holding hands all the time, then going on the giant wheel. The list is too big, it's like neverending. I want to do so many things together with you. </p>

           <p>Once again, thank you so much. I am truly blessed to have you in my life. I pray that the love between us keeps growing, and even God has to say, “Let’s get them married, they’ve waited long enough.” </p>

           <p><strong>Mahal Kita ❤️</strong></p>

           <p style="text-align:right; margin-top: 30px;">Forever yours,<br><strong>Akash</strong></p>

      <h3>🌷 First Hello</h3>
      <p>
        Love, if you remember, it was the month of June, evening time here when I texted you first. I was hoping that you would reply, but I was unsure as I thought you were beyond my reach.
        And I was so shocked to find that you were from the Philippines, I literally stalked your profile and asked you how you have all Indian followers, it was kinda awkward and embarrassing.
        But we still became friends and started talking casually.
      </p>

      <h3>💬 Endless Talks</h3>
      <p>
        We started to talk in the morning and then in the evening. I also sent you photos of our group party, we even talked about attending each other's wedding, not knowing it would be our wedding.
        I remember sometimes Mummy would scold me for delaying dinner, but I really wanted to talk more. Then after I returned to college I tried to make some distance between us by not texting you.
        Instead it made me realise that I can’t spend a day without talking to you. You were really upset with me that time, I’m sorry for that.
        Since then we managed all ups and downs and talked everyday. I really used to get jealous whenever you talked about other boys and it was my first hint that I am falling for you,
        but I ignored and tried to keep things casual which of course didn’t work coz we were destined to be together and I feel so blessed about it.

       <h3>💖 Becoming Us</h3>
       <p>
        You know I found that I have feelings for you on the day of Janmashtami, I was fasting that day and we talked the most that day.
        And finally I expressed myself on September 3rd and you said yes, it was such an unknown feeling I was literally crying but also I was so happy that I wanted to go on jumping all around.
        We have evolved since then and now it's our 2nd monthsary. You’ve become an integral part of my life, every time I think about you and keep on making plans.
        I have also hurt you many times but you forgive me and allow me to become better for you, I am truly grateful to you.
        I love you and hope you keep loving me the way you do. I miss you very much and soon I will come to meet you.
